# Weather Data Normalization 

This project normalizes weather temperature data using **Min-Max Normalization** and **Z-score Standardization**.  
It also visualizes the original vs normalized data and saves the processed dataset.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Reads weather data from CSV (`weather_data.csv`)
- Applies **Min-Max Normalization** (scales 0â€“1)
- Applies **Z-score Standardization** (mean=0, std=1)
- Creates line plot comparison
- Saves processed dataset to `processed_weather_data.csv`
- Saves plot as `plot.png`
